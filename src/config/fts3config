# The default is 400 / Use 0 to disable the check
# MaxUrlCopyProcesses = 400

## Parameters for QoS daemon - BringOnline operation
# Maximum bulk size
# If the size is too large, it will take more resources (memory and CPU) to generate the requests
# and parse the responses. Some servers may reject the requests if they are too big.
# If it is too small, performance will be reduced.
# Keep it to a sensible size (between 100 and 1k)
# StagingBulkSize=200

# Maximum number of concurrent requests
# The maximum number of files sent to the Tape system = StagingBulkSize * StagingConcurrentRequests
# The larger the number, the more requests the QoS daemon will need to keep track of.
# StagingConcurrentRequests=1000

# Seconds to wait before submitting a bulk request
# Allows the QoS daemon to accumulate more files per bulk request.
# Note that the resolution is the StagingSchedulingInterval.

#CleanInterval=7

## SanityChecks Service settings
## Sanity checks are usually demanding as they scan through the database.
## The higher the values for the following parameters,
## the higher the latency for some operations (such as cancellations).
## At the same time, higher values reduce system and/or database load

# In seconds, how often to purge the messaging directory

## Critical services supervision
## Critical threads (e.g.: Scheduler) are supervised by the HeartBeat service.
## When a critical thread has not run in longer than the given grace period,
## the daemon process is running in an abnormal state and will be abruptly stopped
## Note: Make sure the value is large enough to allow a full service run to complete!
## Restriction: The service grace time must be at least 3x larger than the service interval
